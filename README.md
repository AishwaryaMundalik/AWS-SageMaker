# Bank Application Practice with Amazon SageMaker Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources to practice building and improving a **bank application** using **Amazon SageMaker Notebooks**. The goal is to utilize Amazon SageMaker's powerful machine learning capabilities to analyze and model data for various banking-related tasks, such as predicting customer behavior, detecting fraud, or improving the customer experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. **AWS Account**: You must have an AWS account to use Amazon SageMaker. If you don't have one, you can create it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **IAM Permissions**: You need the appropriate permissions to create and use Amazon SageMaker Notebooks within your AWS environment.
3. **Python Knowledge**: Basic understanding of Python and its libraries used for data science and machine learning (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.).

## Setting Up Amazon SageMaker Notebook

To get started with Amazon SageMaker Notebook, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Launch an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance

1. Go to the **Amazon SageMaker Console**.
2. Select **Notebook instances** from the left menu.
3. Click on **Create notebook instance**.
4. Choose an instance type based on your needs (e.g., `ml.t2.medium` for small tasks).
5. Provide a name for your instance (e.g., `bank-application-notebook`).
6. Attach an **IAM role** that has the required permissions for accessing data and other services in your AWS account.
7. Click **Create notebook instance** and wait for the instance to become available.

### Step 2: Open and Set Up Your Notebook

1. Once the instance is ready, click **Open Jupyter** from the SageMaker Console.
2. In Jupyter, you can create new notebooks and upload datasets that simulate bank application data (e.g., customer information, transactions, account status).
3. You can start writing and running Python code to analyze and model data.

### Step 3: Use Pre-built Bank Application Datasets


## Example Notebooks

This repository includes the following example notebooks 

These notebooks contain step-by-step guides for practicing machine learning techniques using the provided datasets.
